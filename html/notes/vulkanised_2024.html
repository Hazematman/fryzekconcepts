<p>Last week I had an exciting opportunity to attend the Vulkanised 2024
conference. For those of you not familar with the event, it is <a
href="https://vulkan.org/events/vulkanised-2024">“The Premier Vulkan
Developer Conference”</a> hosted by the Vulkan working group from
Khronos. With the excitement out of the way, I decided to write about
some of the interesting information that came out of the conference.</p>
<h2 id="a-few-presentations">A Few Presentations</h2>
<p>My colleagues Iago, Stéphane, and Hyunjun each had the opportunity to
present on some of their work into the wider Vulkan ecosystem.</p>
<figure>
<img src="/assets/vulkanised_2024/vulkan_video_web.jpg"

<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Stéphane and Hyujun

<p>Stéphane &amp; Hyunjun presented “Implementing a Vulkan Video Encoder
From Mesa to Streamer”. They jointly talked about the work they
performed to implement the Vulkan video extensions in Intel’s ANV Mesa
driver as well as in GStreamer. This was an interesting presentation
because you got to see how the new Vulkan video extensions affected both
driver developers implementing the extensions and application developers
making use of the extensions for real time video decoding and encoding.
<a

presentation is available on vulkan.org</a>.</p>

<p>Later my colleague Iago presented jointly with Faith Ekstrand (a
well-known Linux graphic stack contributor from Collabora) on “8 Years
of Open Drivers, including the State of Vulkan in Mesa”. They both
talked about the current state of Vulkan in the open source driver
ecosystem, and some of the benefits open source drivers have been able
to take advantage of, like the common Vulkan runtime code and a shared
compiler stack. You can check out <a
href="https://vulkan.org/user/pages/09.events/vulkanised-2024/Vulkanised-2024-faith-ekstrand-collabora-Iago-toral-igalia.pdf">their
presentation for all the details</a>.</p>
<p>Besides Igalia’s presentations, there were several more which I found
interesting, with topics such as Vulkan developer tools, experiences of
using Vulkan in real work applications, and even how to teach Vulkan to
new developers. Here are some highlights for some of them.</p>
<h3 id="using-vulkan-synchronization-validation-effectively"><a
href="https://vulkan.org/user/pages/09.events/vulkanised-2024/vulkanised-2024-john-zulauf-lunarg.pdf">Using
Vulkan Synchronization Validation Effectively</a></h3>
<p>John Zulauf had a presentation of the Vulkan synchronization
validation layers that he has been working on. If you are not familiar
with these, then you should really check them out. They work by tracking
how resources are used inside Vulkan and providing error messages with
some hints if you use a resource in a way where it is not synchronized
properly. It can’t catch every error, but it’s a great tool in the
toolbelt of Vulkan developers to make their lives easier when it comes
to debugging synchronization issues. As John said in the presentation,
synchronization in Vulkan is hard, and nearly every application he
tested the layers on reveled a synchronization issue, no matter how
simple it was. He can proudly say he is a vkQuake contributor now
because of these layers.</p>
<h3 id="years-of-teaching-vulkan-with-example-for-video-extensions"><a
href="https://vulkan.org/user/pages/09.events/vulkanised-2024/vulkanised-2024-helmut-hlavacs.pdf">6
Years of Teaching Vulkan with Example for Video Extensions</a></h3>
<p>This was an interesting presentation from a professor at the
university of Vienna about his experience teaching graphics as well as
game development to students who may have little real programming
experience. He covered the techniques he uses to make learning easier as
well as resources that he uses. This would be a great presentation to
check out if you’re trying to teach Vulkan to others.</p>
<h3 id="vulkan-synchronization-made-easy"><a
href="https://vulkan.org/user/pages/09.events/vulkanised-2024/vulkanised-2024-grigory-dzhavadyan.pdf">Vulkan
Synchronization Made Easy</a></h3>
<p>Another presentation focused on Vulkan sync, but instead of debugging
it, Grigory showed how his graphics library abstracts sync away from the
user without implementing a render graph. He presented an interesting
technique that is similar to how the sync validation layers work when it
comes ensuring that resources are always synchronized before use. If
you’re building your own engine in Vulkan, this is definitely something
worth checking out.</p>
<h3 id="vulkan-video-encode-api-a-deep-dive"><a
href="https://vulkan.org/user/pages/09.events/vulkanised-2024/vulkanised-2024-tony-zlatinski-nvidia.pdf">Vulkan
Video Encode API: A Deep Dive</a></h3>
<p>Tony at Nvidia did a deep dive into the new Vulkan Video extensions,
explaining a bit about how video codecs work, and also including a
roadmap for future codec support in the video extensions. Especially
interesting for us was that he made a nice call-out to Igalia and our
work on Vulkan Video CTS and open source driver support on slide (6)
:)</p>
<h2 id="thoughts-on-vulkanised">Thoughts on Vulkanised</h2>
<p>Vulkanised is an interesting conference that gives you the
intersection of people working on Vulkan drivers, game developers using
Vulkan for their graphics backend, visual FX tool developers using
Vulkan-based tools in their pipeline, industrial application developers
using Vulkan for some embedded commercial systems, and general hobbyists
who are just interested in Vulkan. As an example of some of these
interesting audience members, I got to talk with a member of the Blender
foundation about his work on the Vulkan backend to Blender.</p>
<p>Lastly the event was held at Google’s offices in Sunnyvale. Which I’m
always happy to travel to, not just for the better weather (coming from
Canada), but also for the amazing restaurants and food that’s in the Bay
Area!</p>
