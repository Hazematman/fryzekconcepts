<p>A roughly monthly update about my life</p>
<blockquote>
<h2 id="january-2023">January 2023</h2>
<p>Happy new year! This new year is especially exciting for me because
I’m starting a new job! I’m happy to announce that I’m moving away from
the world of proprietary software. I will now be working with the open
source graphics stack at Igalia. I’ve joined their graphics team, and
I’m super excited to start contributing back to the open source
community that has really shaped my life since I started using Linux
exclusively back around 2011</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<h2 id="november-2022">November 2022</h2>
<p>November was a really exciting month for me. My wife and I had our
wedding and then we went away on our honeymoon for 10 days in France. A
new nice long break from work was nice and let me focus on non technical
things, like improving my health.</p>

<blockquote>
<h2 id="october-2022">October 2022</h2>
<p>After reading about digital gardens, I’ve decided to convert my whole
website into its very own digital garden. I wasn’t too happy with
existing themes and tools I could find online so I decided to try and
build a digital garden engine myself using pandoc and custom
filters.</p>
