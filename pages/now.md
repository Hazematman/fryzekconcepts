A roughly monthly update about my life

> ## January 2023
> Happy new year! This new year is especially exciting for me because I'm starting a
> new job! I'm happy to announce that I'm moving away from the world of proprietary
> software. I will now be working with the open source graphics stack at Igalia. I've joined
> their graphics team, and I'm super excited to start contributing back to the open source
> community that has really shaped my life since I started using Linux exclusively back around
> 2011

> ## November 2022
> November was a really exciting month for me. My wife and I had our wedding and then
> we went away on our honeymoon for 10 days in France. A new nice long break from work
> was nice and let me focus on non technical things, like improving my health. 

> ## October 2022
> After reading about digital gardens, I've decided to convert my whole website into
> its very own digital garden. I wasn't too happy with existing themes and tools I could find
> online so I decided to try and build a digital garden engine myself using pandoc and custom
> filters.
