At the beginning of this month I participated in the Games Institutes's Global Game Jam event. [The Games
Institute](https://uwaterloo.ca/games-institute/) is an organization at my local university 
(The University of Waterloo), that focuses on games based research. Every school term they host a 
game jam, and the one for this term happened to coincide with the Global Game Jam. Since this event was open
to everyone (it's been a few years since I've been a student at UW üë¥Ô∏è), I joined up to try and stretch some
of my more creative muscles. The event was a 48 hour game jam that went from the evening of Friday Feb 3rd 
to Sunday Feb 5th.

The game we created is called [Turtle Roots](https://globalgamejam.org/2023/games/turtle-roots-5), and it
is a simple resource management game. You play as a magical turtle floating through the sky, that requires
water to survive. The turtle can spend some of its "nutrients" to grow roots that will allow it to gather
water and collect more nutrients. The challenge in the game is trying to survive for as long as possible without
running out of water.

## The Team

I attended the event solo and quickly partnered up with two other people, who also attended solo. One member
had already participated in a game jam before and specialized in art, while the other member was attending a
game jam for the first time and was looking for the best way they could contribute, they turned out to have
particular skills for sound, and ended up created all the audio in our game. This left me as the programmer for
our team. 

This also wasn't my first game jam, in 2021 I participated in a 
[Nintendo 64 homebrew game jam](n64brew-gamejam-2021), in 2022 I joined the Puerto Rican Game Developers Association
event for the global game jam, and we submitted [Magnetic Parkour](https://globalgamejam.org/2022/games/magnetic-parkour-6),
I've also participated in [Ludum Dare](https://ldjam.com/) back in around 2013 but I've since lost the link to
my submission. While in high school, and myself and friend participated in two years in a row that sort of worked
like a game jam called "Ottawa Tech Jam" where we submitted [Zorv Warz](http://www.fastquake.com/projects/zorvwarz/)
and [E410](http://www.fastquake.com/projects/worldseed/). As you can probably tell, I really like gamedev. The
desire to build my own video games is actually what originally got me into programming. When I was around 14 years
old I picked up a c++ programming book from the library, since I wanted to try to build my own game and I heard
most game developers use c++. I recall using some proprietary game development library (that I can't recall the
name of), that let you build 2D and 3D games in windows using C++. I didn't really get to far into it until
high school when I started to learn SFML, SDL, and OpenGL. I also dabbled with Unity during that time as well.
But I've always had a strong desire to build most of the foundation of the game myself without using an engine.
You can see the desire really come out on the work I did for Zorv Warz, E410, and the N64 homebrew game jam.
When working with a team I feel it can be a lot easier to use a game engine, even if it doesn't scratch the
same itch for me.

## The Tech Behind the Game

Lately I've had a growing interest in the game engine called [Godot](https://godotengine.org/), and wanted to use
this opportunity to learn the engine more and build a game in it. Godot is interesting to me as its a totally
open source game engine, and as you can probably guess from my job ([](2022_igalia_graphics_team)), open source
software as well as free software is something I'm particularly interested in.

Godot is a really powerful game engine that handles a lot of complexity for you. For example it has a built
in parallax background component, that we took advantage of to add more depth to our game. What this does is
allow you to control the background scrolling speed for different layer of the background, giving the illusion
of depth in a 2D game.

Another powerful feature of Godot is its physics engine. Godot makes it really easy to create physics objects in
your scene and have them do interesting stuff. You might be wondering where physics comes into play in our game,
and we actually use it for the root animations. I setup a sort of "rag doll" system for the roots so they would
flop around in the air as the player moves, really giving a lot more "life" to an otherwise static game.

Godot has a built in scripting language called "GDScript" which is very similar to python. I've really grown to
like this language. It has an optional type system you can take advantage of that helps with reducing the number
of bugs that exist in your game. It also has great connectivity with the editor. This proved useful as I could
"export" variables in the game and allow my team members to modify certain parameters of the game without knowing
any programming. This is super helpful with balancing, and more easily allows non technical members of team to
contribute to the game logic in a more concrete way. 

Overall I'm very happy with how our game turned out. Last year I tried to participate in a few more game jam, but
due to a combination of lack of personal motivation, poor team dynamics, and other factors, none of those game
jams panned out. This was the first game jam in a while where I feel like I really connected with my team and I
also feel like we made a super polished and fun to play game in the end.
