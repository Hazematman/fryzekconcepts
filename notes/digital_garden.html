<p>After reading Maggie Appleton page on <a href="https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history">digital gardens</a> I was inspired to convert my own website into a digital garden.</p>
<p>I have many half baked ideas that I seem to be able to finish. Some of them get to a published state like <a href="/notes/rasterizing-triangles.html">Rasterizing Triangles</a> and <a href="/notes/baremetal-risc-v.html">Baremetal RISC-V</a>, but many of them never make it to the published state. The idea of digital garden seems very appealing to me, as it encourages you to post on a topic even if you haven’t made it “publishable” yet.</p>
<h2 id="how-this-site-works">How this site works</h2>
<p>I wanted a bit of challenge when putting together this website as I don’t do a lot of web development in my day to day life, so I thought it would be a good way to learn more things. This site has been entirely built from scratch using a custom static site generator I setup with pandoc. It relies on pandoc’s filters to implement some of the classic “Digital Garden” features like back linking. The back linking feature has not been totally developed yet and right now it just provides with a convenient way to link to other notes or pages on this site.</p>
<p>I hope to develop this section more and explain how I got various features in pandoc to work as a static site generator.</p>
