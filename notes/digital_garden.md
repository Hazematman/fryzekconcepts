After reading Maggie Appleton page on [digital gardens](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history) I was 
inspired to convert my own website into a digital garden.

I have many half baked ideas that a never finish. Some of them get to a published state like 
[](rasterizing-triangles) and [](baremetal-risc-v), but many of them never make it to the published state. The
idea of digital garden seems very appealing to me, as it encourages you to post on a topic even if you haven't
made it "publishable" yet.
